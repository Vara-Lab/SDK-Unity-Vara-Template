## Examples

### Account

This example demonstrates how to generate an account in Unity using a hexadecimal seed. The seed is converted into a public/private key pair, and the generated account address is logged for debugging.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Account : MonoBehaviour
{
    async void Start()
    {
        // Hexadecimal seed used for account generation. This seed should be kept secure.
        string hexSeed = "......";

        // Generate the account using the provided seed. 
        // This step involves key derivation and conversion from the seed to a public/private key pair.
        var account = AccountService.GenerateAccount(hexSeed);

        // Log the generated account address. This is typically used for debugging purposes.
        // Note: Ensure that sensitive information like private keys or seeds are not logged in production environments.
        Debug.Log($"Address: {account}");
    }
}

```
### Balance

This example shows how to retrieve and display the balance of a specific account on the Vara test network. The account address is provided in hexadecimal format.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Substrate.NetApi.Model.Types;
using Substrate.NetApi.Model.Types.Primitive;

public class Balance : MonoBehaviour
{
    // The WebSocket URL for connecting to the test network of the Vara blockchain.
    private string url = "wss://testnet.vara.network";

    async void Start()
    {
        // Asynchronously fetch the account balance for the specified account address.
        // The address is provided in hex format.
        U128 balance = await BalanceService.GetAccountBalanceAsync(url, "0x......");

        // Log the retrieved balance to the Unity console.
        // This is useful for debugging and verifying that the correct balance is retrieved.
        Debug.Log($"Result: {balance}");
    }
}

```

### Transfer

This example demonstrates how to transfer funds from one account to another on the Vara network. The transaction is signed using the sender's account and the result is logged.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Substrate.NetApi.Model.Types;
using Substrate.NetApi.Model.Types.Primitive;

public class VaraTransfers : MonoBehaviour
{
    // The WebSocket URL for connecting to the test network of the Vara blockchain.
    private string url = "wss://testnet.vara.network";

    async void Start()
    {
        // Hexadecimal seed used to generate the sender's account (Alice's account).
        // This seed should be kept secure as it can be used to regenerate the account's private keys.
        string hexSeed = ".......";
        
        // Generate the account for Alice using the provided seed.
        var aliceAccount = AccountService.GenerateAccount(hexSeed);

        // The recipient's address in hexadecimal format.
        string recipientAddress = "0x..........";

        // The amount to transfer, specified in the smallest unit of the currency .
        long amount = 2000000000000;
        
        // Asynchronously execute the transfer from Alice's account to the recipient's address.
        // The result is a transaction hash or status indicating the success of the transfer.
        string result = await VaraTransferService.TransferAsync(url, aliceAccount, recipientAddress, amount);

        // Log the result of the transfer to the Unity console.
        // This is useful for debugging and verifying that the transfer was successful.
        Debug.Log($"Result: {result}");
    }
}

```

### ProgramSendMessage

This example illustrates how to send a message to a smart contract deployed on the Vara blockchain. It includes setting up the necessary parameters such as gas limit and program ID.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Substrate.NetApi.Model.Types.Primitive;

public class ProgramSendMessage : MonoBehaviour
{
    // The WebSocket URL for connecting to the test network of the Vara blockchain.
    private string url = "wss://testnet.vara.network";

    async void Start()
    {
        // Hexadecimal seed used to generate the sender's account (Alice's account).
        // This seed is sensitive information and should be kept secure.
        string hexSeed = ".......";

        // Generate Alice's account using the provided seed.
        var aliceAccount = AccountService.GenerateAccount(hexSeed);

        // Define the smart contract service and function to call.
        // 'TrafficLight' is the service, and 'Red' is the function.
        string service = "MyService";
        string function = "function";

        // The program ID representing the deployed contract on the Vara blockchain.
        string programId = "0x......";

        // Define the gas limit for executing the transaction. This sets how much computational effort can be used.
        U64 gasLimit = new U64(90000000000); // Arbitrary high gas limit for this transaction.

        // Define the value (funds) being sent with the transaction. U128 is used to define the amount.
        U128 value = new U128(0); // No value is sent with this message, only function execution.

        // Specify whether the account should remain alive (keepAlive). 
        // If true, the account won't be removed even if its balance drops to zero after the transaction.
        bool keepAlive = true;

        // Asynchronously send the message to the smart contract using VaraService.
        // No additional payload is included (set to null).
        string result = await VaraService.SendMessageAsync(
            url, service, function, programId, aliceAccount, gasLimit, value, keepAlive, payload: null
        );

        // Log the result of the message sending operation to the Unity console.
        // This will show the transaction status or result, useful for debugging.
        Debug.Log($"Result: {result}");
    }
}


```

### ProgramReadState

This example demonstrates how to query the state of a smart contract on the Vara network. The contract is defined using an Interface Description Language (IDL), and the query results are logged.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class ProgramReadState : MonoBehaviour
{
    // The WebSocket URL for connecting to the Vara blockchain test network.
    private string url = "wss://testnet.vara.network";

    async void Start()
    {
        // Define the service and function to interact with in the smart contract.
        // 'TrafficLight' is the service.
        string service = "TrafficLight";

        // The query that will be executed on the contract to retrieve the current state.
        string query = "Current";

        // The sender's address in hexadecimal format, which will be used to sign the transaction or query.
        string sender = "0x......";

        // The program ID corresponding to the deployed contract on the Vara blockchain.
        string programId = "0x......";

        // Set the gas limit for executing the transaction or query. This defines the computational resources allocated for the operation.
        long gasLimit = 100000000000; // High gas limit to ensure execution.

        // Set the value being sent along with the transaction. For this query, no value is transferred, so it's set to zero.
        int value = 0;

        // Define the Interface Description Language (IDL) for the smart contract.
        // The IDL describes the structure of types and services provided by the contract, which helps in decoding the results of queries and calls.
        string idl = @"My IDL....;";

        // Asynchronously query the state of the smart contract using the QueryService.
        // The query will return the current state as described in the IDL.
        object result = await QueryService.QueryStateAsync(
            url, idl, service, query, sender, programId, gasLimit, value, payload: null
        );

        // Log the result of the query to the Unity console for debugging and verification.
        Debug.Log($"Result: {result}");
    }
}

```

## Explanation

1. **Assign the test node URL to the variable `url`**:  
   In each example, the `url` variable holds the WebSocket URL that connects to the Vara test network. This URL points to the node where all interactions take place, such as querying the blockchain state, sending transactions, or interacting with smart contracts.

2. **Generate or use an account**:  
   For most examples, an account is either generated from a provided seed or used directly. This account is necessary for signing transactions and authenticating actions on the blockchain. It’s crucial to keep the seed secure as it can regenerate the account’s private keys.

3. **Initialize the Substrate client**:  
   The `SubstrateClientExt` is initialized with the `url`, which establishes the connection between your Unity project and the Vara blockchain node. This client handles all interactions with the blockchain, including sending transactions and querying data.

4. **Connect the client asynchronously**:  
   The client connects to the blockchain node asynchronously. This ensures that the connection is established without blocking the main thread, which is important for maintaining responsiveness in Unity.

5. **Interact with the blockchain**:  
   Depending on the example, the interaction might involve retrieving the account balance, sending a transaction, or querying the state of a smart contract. These operations are performed asynchronously to ensure that Unity's main thread remains responsive.

6. **Log the results**:  
   After completing the blockchain interaction, the results are logged using Unity's `Debug.Log`. This logging helps with debugging by displaying the output directly in the Unity console, allowing developers to verify that the operations have been executed successfully.
